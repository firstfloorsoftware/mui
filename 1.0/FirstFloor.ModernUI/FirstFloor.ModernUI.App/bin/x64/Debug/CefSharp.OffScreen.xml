             Immediately returns a copy of the last rendering from Chrome,
             or null if no rendering has occurred yet.
             
             Chrome also renders the page loading, so if you want to see a complete rendering,
             only start this task once your page is loaded (which you can detect via FrameLoadEnd
             or your own heuristics based on evaluating JavaScript).
            
             It is your responsibility to dispose the returned Bitmap.
             
             The bitmap size is determined by the Size property set earlier.
