- Nothing is needed in the front facing project (UNLESS you
  are using any of the icons listed below in the attribution section).
- Commercial use is not only allowed but encouraged. Do not worry you
  do not have to attribute, I know how much of a pain that is. If it is
  an icon in the attribution list below, you still need to attribute those!
- Do not distribute the entire package (I've allowed this dozens of
  times for open source projects, but email me first).

** Developers and designers that emailed Templarian the source .design icons to be added into the package. PNGs also accepted, but may take longer to be added.
*** Icons I've copied so closely you want to attribute them and are also under the CC license.
